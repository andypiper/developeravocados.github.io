## Feedback

[Give us feedback!](https://github.com/developeravocados/developeravocados.github.io/issues/new?template=feedback.md) We'd love to make this newsletter better together with our readers, and we appreciate every bit of feedback you have for us. Let us know what you think about the newsletter and how we can make it better.

## CFPs

[Submit a CFP!](https://github.com/developeravocados/developeravocados.github.io/issues/new?template=cfp.md) We look for a couple of things in the conferences we're putting in the newsletter. They have to have a Code of Conduct, a diverse speaker lineup and to at least offer travel and accomodation assistance for the speakers. We like the ones that offer assistance for all speakers, but we'll accept the ones that only offer it for part of the speakers.

## Content

[Submit content!](https://github.com/developeravocados/developeravocados.github.io/issues/new?template=content.md) We try to curate the articles, videos and podcasts published in the week prior to the newsletter publish day, which is always a Monday. Please try to submit only content that fits that 8 day window.
