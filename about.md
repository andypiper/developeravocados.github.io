## Why Developer Avocados 🥑?

A [few](https://www.marythengvall.com/blog/2018/1/31/developer-avocados-the-good-kind-of-fat) [people](https://blog.usejournal.com/the-birth-of-developer-avocados-61e4ac235033) wrote about Developer Avocados  online, and how they were born. We're not going into that here. We loved the idea of "the good kind of fat" and most important:

>A Developer Avocado is someone whose primary responsibility is to make life easier for developers.

And that's what we do!
