<!-- We look for a couple of things in the conferences we're putting in the newsletter. They have to have a Code of Conduct, a diverse speaker lineup and to at least offer travel and accomodation assistance for the speakers. We like the ones that offer assistance for all speakers, but we'll accept the ones that only offer it for part of the speakers. -->
