## Why Developer Avocados ðŸ¥‘

A [few](https://www.marythengvall.com/blog/2018/1/31/developer-avocados-the-good-kind-of-fat) [people](https://blog.usejournal.com/the-birth-of-developer-avocados-61e4ac235033) wrote about Developer Avocados  online, and how they were born. We're not going into that here. We just loved the idea of "the good kind of fat" and most importantly:

>A Developer Avocado is someone whose primary responsibility is to make life easier for developers.

And that's what we do!

## Why Developer Avocados ðŸ¥‘ Weekly

We've always thought there's not eneough Developer Avocados out there, and we wanted to help change that. When we started out we used to read [Technically Speaking](https://techspeak.email/) a lot, but Cate and Chiu-Ki took a break. We've waited this past year for someone to pick up the slack and come up with a replacement. Turns out, it's us ðŸ˜…! We want to keep a similar minimalist format with a few highly curated resources and a few good conference CFPs. Delivered every week in your inbox. But we are changing the focus from strictly public speaking to resources and tips geared towards helping you become a Developer Avocado ðŸ¥‘!

So Developer Avocados ðŸ¥‘ Weekly is a curated list of articles, tweets, resources and CFPs. It saves you time and all the FOMO of missing out. ðŸ’Œ You could just read the [archive](https://tinyletter.com/developeravocados/archive), but we feel this weekly email in your inbox is going to keep reminding you there is a world of avocados out there, just like you, so please subscribe ðŸ’š. We'd appreciate you spreading the word on social media if you like what you see.
