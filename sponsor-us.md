We've been asked to share job ads and CTAs in the newsletter for a while now, so we're giving it a try. By sponsoring an issue, you get 280 characters to describe your ask. They'll run in the middle of the newsletter, and on the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/devrelavocados). There are only 2 available per issue, first come, first placed.

We're doing sponsorships on a per issue or per month basis for now, and we'll see how that goes.

_Per issue_. One-off sponsorship. 250 GBP per issue.

_Bulk_. If you sponsor 3 issues, we'll give you the 4th issue for free. 750 GBP per 4 issues.

If you've had something else in mind, [send us an email](mailto:mail@developeravocados.net).
